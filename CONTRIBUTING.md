# Contributing to the iNaturalist Toolbox

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This is a curated list of projects built using the [iNaturalist API](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/), including tools, games, visualizations, learning resources, and more.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Add a New Project

To add a new item:

- Fork the repository.
- Add your project to the appropriate category in `README.md`. If no suitable category exists, feel free to suggest a new one.
- Use the following format:

  ```markdown
  * [Project Name](https://link-to-project) by [Author Name](https://github.com/username) – Short description of what the project does.
  ```

- Keep the list alphabetically sorted within each category (by project name).
- Open a pull request with a clear description of what you’re adding.

### 2. Improve Descriptions or Categorization

If you notice:

- A project is missing a description or author link
- A tool is listed in the wrong category
- There's a clearer way to explain something

Please open a pull request or create an issue to discuss the change.

### 3. Report Issues

If you notice a broken link, inaccurate description, or any other issue, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/simonrolph/inat_toolbox/issues) to let us know.

## Guidelines

- Only include projects that use or are powered by the iNaturalist API or data.
- Open-source and public-facing tools are preferred, but well-documented closed-source projects may be included if relevant.
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions.
